<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

JAR-Scanner is a python based tool performing the analysis of all the JARs which are bundled as part of the product release. The main objective of this tool is to find the 3rd party JARs in the project and check if the license has been procured or not. It is done by comparing all the jars with the existing License document which contains the list JARs with already procured licenses. The tool will also project the JARs which are no longer used in the project.
